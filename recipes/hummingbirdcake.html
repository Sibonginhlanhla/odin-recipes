            <li>1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <h4>cream cheese frosting:</h4>
            <li>1 pound confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>¼ pound butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans.</li>
            <li>To make the cake: Sift flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Combine bananas, oil, walnuts, pineapple, and eggs in another large bowl; mix well.</li>
            <li>Stir flour mixture into banana mixture until combined. Pour batter into the prepared pans.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of each pan comes out clean, about 1 hour. Allow cakes to cool on wire racks.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make frosting: Beat together confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, butter, and vanilla in a medium bowl until smooth.</li>
            <li>Evenly spread frosting on the middle, sides, and top of cooled cake.</li>
        </ol>
